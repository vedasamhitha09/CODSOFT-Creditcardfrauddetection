# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression

This repository contains Python code for building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression.

## Overview

Fraudulent transactions in credit card data can lead to significant financial losses for both customers and businesses. Detecting these fraudulent transactions is crucial for maintaining the security of financial systems. In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine based on various features.
